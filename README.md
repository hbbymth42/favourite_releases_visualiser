# Favourite Music Releases Visualiser

A Multi-Page Streamlit Application which visualises a database of my favourite music releases (Albums, EPs, Soundtracks, etc.).

Code mainly consists of Python and additional relevant packages:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SQLAlchemy
- Plotly

Current version of visualiser can be seen [here](https://favourite-music-releases-visualiser.streamlit.app)!
